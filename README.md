## What's needed for Mac Support
The way programs are installed and even run on a mac are very different from a PC (ex: where the programs are stored and even how they're compiled/ran). I need to have the functions in the Data class that install things for PC to be changed so that they can Install things on Macs. Since I don't know much about Macs, what else needs to be changed in regards to the software I'm unaware of.

Note: The programs are stored in Dropbox, I'll have to upload the Mac versions of the programs since I only have the windows one right now.
